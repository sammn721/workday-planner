# workday-planner
A daily planner covering standard business hours.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a dynamic workday planner.
- Users are presented with an hourly planner, going from 9AM to 5PM.
- Users can save or delete text for each hour.
- Text boxes will change color according to time of day.

##Usage
- Clicking in one of the text boxes will allow users to enter text.
- Each box has an accompanying blue "save" button that will save any text entered in that box.
- When the day begins, most of the day will be green and the current hour will be red.
- As the day progresses, past hours will turn grey while the current hour will always change to red.
